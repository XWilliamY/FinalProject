Stage 1: Contextualization

A. Text-Based Adventure Game

Let's step away from the graphics-heavy, story-lacking games that are popular today. Let's use our imagination instead, and build a new world on words alone. 
Features: arraylist that contains all the rooms that one can possibly explore

Calling a certain room in an arraylist will call for another arraylist that contains descriptions of that room, etc

user-input commands will allow for interaction with the world
"eg : go north" = character goes forward a set value X, and this value X will be documented in another arraylist.

Map will be a grid, probably using two arrays (one that is linear in the x, and another linear in the y) 

Using 2D array [y][x]

row x column
